array rsdnm has NaN value before calling verify(), it's modified in func ssor
in func ssor, rsdnm is modified by func l2norm
in func l2norm, sum(rsdnm) relies on v(rsd in ssor)
in func ssor, rsd relies on dt and func buts
in func buts, if debug_003() is enabled, it seems v(rsd in ssor) has right values, but page fault error randomly emerges
